# MCP-PDB: Python Debugger Interface for Claude/LLMs

MCP-PDB provides tools for using Python's debugger (pdb) with Claude and other LLMs through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This was inspired by [debug-gym](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-gym/) by Microsoft, which showed gains in various coding benchmarks by providing a coding agent access to a python debugger.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This tool executes Python code through the debugger. Use in trusted environments only.

## Installation

Works best with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/)

### Claude Code
```bash
# Install the MCP server
claude mcp add mcp-pdb -- uv run --with mcp-pdb mcp-pdb
# or for poetry
claude mcp add mcp-pdb -- poetry run mcp-pdb

# Alternative: Install with specific Python version
claude mcp add mcp-pdb -- uv run --python 3.13 --with mcp-pdb mcp-pdb

# Note: The -- separator is required for Claude Code CLI
```

    "mcp-pdb": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp-pdb",

      ]
    }
  }
}

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code Installation Issues

If you encounter an error like:
```
MCP server "mcp-pdb" Connection failed: spawn /Users/xxx/.local/bin/uv run --python 3.13 --with mcp-pdb mcp-pdb ENOENT
```

Make sure to include the `--` separator when using `claude mcp add`:
```bash
# ✅ Correct
claude mcp add mcp-pdb -- uv run --with mcp-pdb mcp-pdb

# ❌ Incorrect (missing --)
claude mcp add mcp-pdb uv run --with mcp-pdb mcp-pdb
```

To verify your installation:
```bash
# Check if mcp-pdb is listed
claude mcp list | grep mcp-pdb

# Check server status in Claude Code
# Type /mcp in Claude Code to see connection status
```
